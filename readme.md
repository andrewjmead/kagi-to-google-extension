# Kagi to Google

Kagi to Google is a simple browser extension that redirects a Kagi SERP to a Google SERP using Command+G or Ctrl+G.

I have no plans to add this to any extension store. If you think it would be useful, checkout `background.js` to see what it does, clone the repo, and then manually install the extension.

You can manually install the extension by visiting `chrome://extensions/`. Turn on developer mode on that page. Click "Load unpacked" and select the repository folder to install it.
